<h3>bookmarklet instructions</h3>
<p>Go to https://spot-maze-chinchilla.glitch.me/ingot.js (on your school chromebook of course)
Make a bookmark with the code there.
Once that is done. If you have Securly go to https://tinyurl.com/bettergoofcurly if it says blocked by chrome, reload(you have to actually have securly ofc) If you have iBoss go to https://tinyurl.com/goofboss,
If you have Cisco Umbrella go to https://tinyurl.com/goofumbrella If you have Blocksi go to https://tinyurl.com/goofsi And if you have GoGuardian(might not work) go to https://tinyurl.com/goofguardian. Now most of these links are a block page(this is intentional) on each page should have a blue link, click the link on the page if it opens a blank page click the bookmarklet that you just made and click either hard disable or soft disable, you can also run some of the scripts and run your own code, your extension may disable javascript being ran on it, so running your own code may not work. Extra notes
I recommend doing soft disable, which only disables it until restart.
  If your school updated GoGuardian, this exploit may not work.</p>
